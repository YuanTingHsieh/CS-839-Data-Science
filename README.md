## Project Overview

In this project, we collect data, "wrangle" the data, 
by extracting/cleaning/matching/integrating the data into a single unified data set, 
then analyze that data set to infer insights.

The purpose is to walk us through the whole pipeline of DS from data to analysis.
The task of each stage is listed below:
1. Stage 1: [Information extraction from natural text](https://sites.google.com/site/anhaidgroup/courses/cs-838-spring-2018/project-description/stage-1)
2. Stage 2: [Crawling and extracting structured data from Web pages](https://sites.google.com/site/anhaidgroup/courses/cs-838-spring-2018/project-description/stage-2)
3. Stage 3: [Entity matching](https://sites.google.com/site/anhaidgroup/courses/cs-838-spring-2018/project-description/stage-3)
4. Stage 4: [Integrating and performing analysis](https://sites.google.com/site/anhaidgroup/courses/cs-838-spring-2018/project-description/stage-4)
